# Valhalla CF

Valhalla CF is a simple form with only name, email, phone, subject, and message fields, but it gets its job done very well. After installing it, you just have to use the shortcode [valhalla-cf], and you’re ready to go. But in the WordPress Customizer, you can change labels, messages, the address used with Google Maps, and colors. It also has a built-in CAPTCHA that will keep spammers far away. Valhalla CF is built with Bootstrap, so it’s responsive and beautiful out of the box.
